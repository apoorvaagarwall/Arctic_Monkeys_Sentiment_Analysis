"Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point is that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all OK to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
'Cause their minds are made up
And course is all OK to carry on that way
But I said no, oh no!
Well oh, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go, oh no, no?

But over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known them for a long long time
And yet they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
No not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no!",A Certain Romance
"There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he’s fit
And you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though

Now you don't know what she's up to you can only assume
If she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that’s what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She’s looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's so clear you were though

Have you heard what she has been doing? Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
She’s been with all of the boys but, never went very far
And she wagged English and science just to go in his car

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in
Oh now the girls have grown
Yeah but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know

To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best...

"Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom

There's a super cool band yeah

Tinting the solitude

When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun-gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

And a helter skelter around her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs a shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul

But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And a kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

"Both sides, and softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger flicks you on your socks

I'll go high pitched, he'll talk and make you voice sound high pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone

It's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to calve his jaw, it's impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tear you out the day after a triumph is as hollow
As the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying 'Bye'

And you would queue up to listen to him pissing
And hang around to watch some poor girl bluff
And then they chase him down the avenue
Incessently pestering him to let him join the club

He knows how to put a cork in the foot
And just how to shut up the charming ones of us
And they've seen him talking to your lady friend

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal
Where he'll teach you all the bits they missed

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try

You thrive on dancing in our laps
Before the more familiar chaps
And all the curtain leads to fever

We watched the womanizer cry
And in the last sip you and I
Declared we might require a breather

I am the truth true through and I
Convey excitement fluently
As solid as I can busk shock

With well presented merry men
And I know all too well
I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

Revealing silk and fit

When you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sache of brats

And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slots

And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowels hide and wait to rot away

She says ""See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me-""
Well I interrupted, received the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there

Would it be outrageous to say we're either shouting or we're shagging, docked in tempestuous bays?
At least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me like Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it just hit me we can't go back to the chest touching on the back",Too Much To Ask
"The mixture between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear,
You wonder where she is,
This afternoon.

And does it get on your nerves,
Make you slightly perturbed,
That there's things that you don't know about her?
And even the places that she's never been with yer,
seem awful empty without her.

You can't look into those eyes,
Down no telephone line,
What if you were right first time? [x2]

"I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't try and turn on the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl I'm in a muddle tonight
Would you tell me where you're gonna take it
If I had a heart you're the one who should break it

The engines running, can't decide if I should ride away
You and I
You and I

I had a woman, she went away
And now I'm lonely...Fuck it

"You got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows
Catty eyelashes and your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple A passes
At the cemetary gates

Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, babe
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark

And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw your driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque
You watch Italian horror and you listen to the scores
Leather-clad and spike collar
I want you down on all fours

Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, babe

I know you're nothing like mine
Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love would tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
Cause I don't shun the daylight
But baby I'm willing to start

You're so dark

Got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allen Poe
Got your unkind of ravens
Got your murder of crows

You're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark, oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby",You're So Dark
